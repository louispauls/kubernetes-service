== Overview

To create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cluster through https://nks.netapp.io[NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS)], you will need to:

1. Create an AWS user.
2. Create a policy which grants full access to:
  * Autoscaling
  * CloudWatch
  * EC2
  * Elastic Load Balancing
  * IAM
  * Route 53
3. Attach this policy to the user.

== Create an AWS User

To create a user, sign into https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home[the AWS Management Console] and click Services.

In the **Security, Identity & Compliance** column, click **IAM**.

Click **Users**.

Click **Add User**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/click-add-user.png?raw=true[AWS Auth: Click Add Users]


Enter the **User Name** then choose the **Access type.**

If this user will only be used to access the API, SDK, and other development tools, click **Programmatic access.** If this user is for someone who will need to log in to the AWS Management Console, choose **AWS Management Console access**.

Then click **Next: Permissions** to continue.


image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/select-access-type.png?raw=true[AWS Auth: Select Access Type]

Choose whether to add the user to a group, copy permissions from an existing user, or attach existing policies directly.

Note: Amazon recommends using groups as a "best practice" way to manage user permissions.

If you need to create a new policy, see the next section for our recommended policy details.

If you choose to add the user to a group, you can either create a new group or select an existing group.

Then click **Next: Review** to continue.


image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/create-group.png?raw=true[AWS Auth: Create Group]

Confirm the new user's information, then click **Create user** to create the user.

Click **Download .csv** and save the user's security credentials to your computer.

Then click **Close** to return to the **Users** page.

== Create an AWS Policy

When creating a new AWS policy, you will need to allow your user full access to the following services:

* Autoscaling
* CloudWatch
* EC2
* Elastic Load Balancing
* IAM
* Route 53

For an easy way to create a single policy to grant all the necessary access, click **Policies**. You can also access this page from the user account creation process by selecting **Attach existing policies directly > Create policy**.


image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/attach-existing-policy.png?raw=true[AWS Auth: Attach Existing Policies]

Click **Create Policy**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/click-create-policy.png?raw=true[AWS Auth: Click Create Policy]

Click to select **Create Your Own Policy**.

image::assets/documentation/create-auth-credentials-on-aws/create-your-own-policy.png?raw=true[AWS Auth: Create Your Own Policy]


Fill out the **Policy Name** field with a name you will be able to identify, like `NKSCloudPolicy`.

Note that you can only use alphanumeric characters plus a few other characters like `-` and `+`. You cannot use spaces in the policy name.

Copy the following and paste it into the **Policy Document** field:

----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": "ec2:*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "cloudwatch:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "autoscaling:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
